PAX Schedule Creator
====================
This tool lets you create an iCalendar file(The standard calendar file format) of the PAX schedule. This will be kept up to date with the most recent XML schedule we can get from Penny Arcade, usually about a month before the convention.
This tool is not affilaited with Penny Arcade or PAX, it is merely a community tool to help people keep track of events at PAX.
