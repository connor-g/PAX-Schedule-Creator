<paneltitle>Does Story Matter in Video Games?</paneltitle>
<paneltime>11:30am - 12:30pm</paneltime>
<paneldescription>Most triple A games spend a large portion of their budget in scripting and recording voice actors - and sometimes dogs - in order to deliver powerful stories, and experiencing these stories is what draws many gamers to play. And yet, critics routinely decry how video games aren't very good at it. The argument could be made to abandon detailed narratives and concentrate on making games more enjoyable to play. The younger audience doesn't even watch cutscenes anymore, often skipping them to get to the "fun part". Should we stop trying to portray characters and tell stories with games when other media do it better? It's the mechanics that make it a game, right? Why bother trying to mimic movies and TV? And if story is an integral part of video games, how can game designers learn how to tell stories using all the best parts of the interactive medium? This discussion of top game designers and writers across different genres will tell us why game stories matter.</paneldescription>

<paneltime>12:30pm - 1:30pm</paneltime>
<paneldescription>Video games are big business, but how easy is it to get started working on the inside? Luckily for many of us, you don't necessarily have to have artistic or programming skills to land a rewarding job in the videogame industry. Career opportunities in videogame journalism, marketing, public relations, community management, business development and even running your own game studio are all available to those with the passion, preparation and perseverance. During this panel, you'll hear from industry pros on how they got their start in the biz, and what you can do to forge your own career out of your favorite hobby. These veterans (who hail from publishers, game studios both large and small as well as media and entertainment networks) will cover topics such as what courses you should take in school, what types of experience and internships will set you up for success, and how to go about landing your first industry gig. The panel will be fun, personal and insightful, with an emphasis on audience Q~ampersand~A.</paneldescription>

<paneltitle>Achieving Gender Diversity in Gaming: OK, Now What?</paneltitle>
<paneltime>1:00pm - 2:00pm</paneltime>
<paneldescription>Many times when the issue of gender equality in the virtual realm is discussed, the topic turns towards solutions: what can we do as a community to embrace this impending culture shift at the benefit of all and expense of none? The idea of this panel is to emphasize listening, generate discussion, bring unity, and initiate constructive criticism to bring about change in the games industry. As developers, web site owners, publishers, writers, and fans, we all have the ability to collaborate and contribute to the inclusion of all gender and sexual identities. We hope with this group of people to explore the possibilities and foster a positive atmosphere where our peers can pursue avenues towards progress. </paneldescription>

Why did games in Europe often run slower? Why were third generation NES games substantially better? Just how far could the NES be pushed with additional cartridge hardware? The limitations of the NES defined the games and gave programmers technical puzzles to solve each project.

<paneldescription>Seattle is more than just the home of PAX Prime. The greater Seattle region is a major hub of the gaming industry. But how did that happen? Is it really because of the rain?

In 2015, this story will be part of an exhibit at the National Museum of American History. Get a sneak peak of this project at PAX Prime! </paneldescription>

Not only is making your own video game fun, it is a great way to learn a little math and programming along the way.

<paneldescription>True story: At PAX East 2013, we were worried that the SECRET FINAL ROUND game of Spaceteam wouldn't survive the torrent of invisible mega-beams shooting out of 6,000 nearby mobile devices to keep a stable game running. The awesome dudes over at the Behemoth heard our plight and offered Battleblock Theater as a backup, but because we are stupid and dumb, we ended up not using Battleblock and were overrun with the most intense infestation of Space Rats ever known to man. Fast forward to today, where we still love Battleblock and figured it should be an Omegathon game ANYWAY because of how great it is. History lesson over. 16 contestants enter, and 12 will leave.</paneldescription>

<paneltitle>Teaming Up for Indie Game Dev</paneltitle>
<paneltime>10:00am - 11:00am</paneltime>
<paneldescription>No one is in island, especially when developing a video game. To bring a project from conception to release, developers must often look outside themselves to give their title the best chance to succeed. Staff members of indie studios and solo developers alike join to discuss what it takes to bring a game together, how to establish a healthy team environment, the importance of being able to work with both specialists and those who can wear multiple hats and more. With a Q~ampersand~A session scheduled as well, it should be an excellent opportunity for anyone aspiring to make it in the video games industry.</paneldescription>

<paneltitle>Living the Dream: The Tales, Trials, and Tribulations of the Geek Shop Keep</paneltitle>
<paneltime>10:00am - 11:00am</paneltime>
<paneldescription>The man (or woman) behind the counter. The person that knows everything about every product they sell. They play all the video games, they've read ALL the comics, they know who issued what toy when, where you can find it, and how much it is worth! Well, that's the image anyway. As children, many a young nerd, geek, or dork has wonderful daydreams about owning a comic book store, video game store, or toy store. How amazing it would be to chat with like-minded patrons about your favorite rarities and nostalgic items of old. But what is it really like? Is it all fantasy-casting films, long discussions on the greatest, little-known villains, and boasting about ownership of obscure game systems? Let our store owners and managers give you the gritty, and often-times frustrating, reality beneath the high-gloss dream of owning your own geek-shop.</paneldescription>

<paneltime>10:30am - 11:30am</paneltime>
<paneldescription>Once upon a time in gaming, damsels were always in distress and fighting dudes rescued them. But the gaming audience has changed. As demand increases for characters as diverse as the new player base, the games industry struggles to catch up. Writers and designers feel pressured to craft fresh, compelling stories that speak to a wider audience, but are often challenged by personal blind spots, professional culture, and business demands. Our panel of veteran writers and designers will look beyond blame and gender swapping to share their experiences-good, bad, and hilarious-of trying to break free from cliched thinking. Whether you're an industry hopeful or a thinking gamer, you won't want to miss this talk about the future of storytelling.</paneldescription>

<paneltitle>Fun Facts ~ampersand~ the Dirty Truth: Your Video Game Debates Put To Rest</paneltitle>
<paneltime>11:00am - 12:00pm</paneltime>
<paneldescription>That game you've been waiting for was delayed, or not released in your country, or censored, or only released on Xbox! Why? What's really going on? From fun facts to the dirty truth, rumors are put to rest as this session details the entire process of developing and releasing games. Learn the real story behind why games are often released in Europe later, or not in Australia or Japan at all. How are games rated? What causes game delays? Why do games often hit Xbox first? How does each console stack up from the developer's perspective? What does it take to become a console developer? What is the role of a game publisher in the age of digital-only games? This session settles much debated behind the scenes topics. </paneldescription>

<paneltime>2:30pm - 3:30pm</paneltime>
<paneldescription>Whether creating a multi-session campaign for a table-top roleplaying game or writing a branching storyline for a video game, crafting interactive narratives can be a difficult task. How do you take someone through a traditional story-arc when they make all the decisions? Which linear storytelling techniques work in an interactive narrative and which don't? How do you apply these stories in a digital medium without sacrificing the freedom of the player? Join Andrew Fischer, a designer of the Edge of the Empire Star Wars roleplaying game; Annie VanderMeer Mitsoda, a writer and designer from DoubleBear Productions; Matt Harkrader, freelance game editor; and potential special guests in exploring these issues. They will discuss applying classic storytelling archetypes in an interactive environment, using creative problem-solving to deal with unexpected player choices, and creating interactive narrative structures for digital games.</paneldescription>

<paneltitle>Gaming or Gambling? Scientific and Legal Perspectives on Today's Games</paneltitle>
<paneltime>3:00pm - 4:00pm</paneltime>
<paneldescription>Years ago, gamers were asked to pay up front to play a game: by purchasing at the register, or by inserting another quarter. But with new "free"-to-play, DLC, "booster packs", real-money auction houses and other in-game and microtransaction models, gamers are now actively encouraged to open up their wallets when playing games... sometimes involving significant, real-world money. Join psychiatrist Dr. Tyler Black and video game lawyer Ryan Black as they discuss the interaction between addiction, gambling, and even problem gaming with video gaming, from both a scientific and legal perspective. ...and, yes, they're twins (of the non-quantum type, Booker).</paneldescription>

<paneltime>3:30pm - 4:30pm</paneltime>
<paneldescription>Good news, everyone! The trolls aren't winning. Right now, game companies are working to encourage positive competitive play, as well as adding in-game consequences for not-so-friendly behaviors. Join us as we discuss how design decisions affect player interactions, learn about the unique challenges developers face when shaping their particular communities, and examine what we think we know about online behavior.</paneldescription>

<paneltitle>Crafting Minecraft: The Future of Gaming is Open Source Culture</paneltitle>
<paneltime>4:00pm - 5:00pm</paneltime>
<paneldescription>Video game fan communities have a strong history of co-production with official game developers, through mods, bug testing, and community feedback. One possible future is expanding upon this participation to include players in the ongoing development of a game. Minecraft, of course, epitomizes that process: as soon as the game launched in alpha, players contributed thousands of mods and ancillary content to the franchise, so that Mojang had to pay attention. Based on a year-long ethnographic study, Ph.D. student Alex Leavitt presents an in-depth exploration of how Minecraft players navigate participation in the game's ever-expanding world and how Minecraft has evolved over the past few years as "open source" culture.</paneldescription>

<paneldescription>Celebrated as the "father of MegaMan," but branded as an outspoken critic of the Japanese game industry, ex-Capcom honcho Keiji Inafune's frank talk, controversial opinions, and - most of all - his games have made many fans (and maybe a few enemies) on both sides of the Pacific. Join us for an informal chat through Inafune's 25 year career: where console gaming began, how it's changed over the years, and what's coming next - both for the industry and for Inafune himself.</paneldescription>

How is a generation of students raised on Fruit Ninja, Bioshock and Minecraft reacting to games designed primarily for (dare we say it) EDUCATION?! Join a panel of serious game developers who've taken the skills they used in the consumer game industry and applied them to the dark arts of education, business and health care. They will be discussing feedback from students and others who are currently using serious games, lessons learned by the developers, and what the future holds for serious games.</paneldescription>

<paneltitle>You Game Like A Girl: Tales of Trolls ~ampersand~ White Knights</paneltitle>
<paneltime>7:30pm - 8:30pm</paneltime>
<paneldescription>Women in gaming and "fake nerd girls" have become a topic of much debate recently. For every voice raised in favor of critically addressing the climate for women in gaming and nerdom, a dozen more cry out in defensive, silencing backlash. This panel offers a discussion of these issues, not from the outside, but from the inside, bringing together five women from across the nerd community who have faced trolls and white knights and lived to tell their tales. The panel includes game designer Shoshana Kessock, Ashly Burch from the web series Hey Ash Whatcha Playin, cosplay model/game designer Stella Chuu, and sex educator/nerdlesque performer Iris Explosion. This panel will also discuss positive strategies to create a safer, more supportive community for women at cons and in the gaming community at large. Moderated by the founder of D20 Burlesque, Anja Keister.</paneldescription>

<paneltitle>Is Storytelling the Most Important Element in Games?</paneltitle>
<paneltime>10:30am - 11:30am</paneltime>
<paneldescription>Top secret research has recently revealed that the majority of gamers value one thing in video games more than any other element: story. Some game creators see in these results a call to arms for a new wave of story- and narrative-based games. Others disagree, even going as far as declaring story "unnecessary," "irksome," and "a waste of resources and time." Our panel of industry veterans will argue whether narrative is important for games, discuss the games that prove their point, and attempt to answer the question: story-based games: fad or the future?</paneldescription>

<paneldescription>Yes, you can make games too! Many universities offer game degrees, but game developers can come from backgrounds in writing, psychology, biology, history, theatre--and we believe these perspectives enrich the games space. Hobbyists, amateurs, students, hopefuls, indies and superstars alike are invited to learn how to seek out opportunities and how to create their own. Panelists, including developers of such games as Journey and Assassin's Creed 2, will share their unique path into the industry, offer advice and discuss how they want to see the industry grow: we want you to make the games you want to play!</paneldescription>

And why is this shift important for games as a medium?

<paneldescription>Lyrics about comics? Check! Beats made from classic video games? Check! References to your favorite science fiction, fantasy, tabletop, board game, or CCG? Check, check, and double-check! Nerdcore is a sub-genre of hip hop that is both easy to generalize and hard to define. Sure, there are songs about Megaman, Doctor Who, Star Wars, and other corners of fandom, but there are also classic hip hop tropes of isolation, loneliness, love, and cultural empowerment. Join Godfather of Nerdcore, MC Frontalot, and the Capcom-laureate himself, Mega Ran, along with others as they discuss their experiences and opinions on Nerdcore and hip hop in general. They'll cover the history of the sub-genre, where it is at currently, and where all this geek-driven rap might be going in the future. For those that attend the panel, a limited number of Nerdcore sample CDs will be provided for free from current artists, known and unknown, in the community. </paneldescription>

<paneldescription>Creative Assembly's Craig Laycock hosts a panel on the place of history in contemporary gaming. Is it little better than a cheap background for designers and story-tellers to make any old game against? Does it matter if you get it wrong if the outcome is more fun? Does history actually have something relevant to say to gamers that isn't being heard or is it fine to keep it to the classroom and let us get on with fun without the slavish shackles? What happens when fans think you've got it wrong and crossed a line? The company is Sega and Creative Assembly.</paneldescription>

<paneltitle>Foreplay: Romance in Games</paneltitle>
<paneltime>7:30pm - 8:30pm</paneltime>
<paneldescription>Whatever happened to foreplay? People tend to talk (and program) a lot about sex in games and forget all about the delicious build up. But with growing female and non-traditional male consumer bases, game developers are starting to reach beyond the adolescent male fantasy. You can get hitched in Skyrim, have a steamy bath with your lady in Witcher 2, and woo a whole lot of different people in Mass Effect... and that's just the tip of the iceberg. Moderated Sean Baptiste (Fire Hose Games, When I Grow Up), BioWare writer and novelist Patrick Weekes (Mass Effect trilogy, Dragon Age: Inquisition, The Palace Job), BioWare lead editor Karin Weekes (Dragon Age: Origins, Dragon Age II, Mass Effect 2, Mass Effect 3), freelance writer/producer Miellyn Fitzwater Barrows (Strange Loves: Vampire Boyfriends, Strange Loves 2: Hex Boyfriends) join podcast hosts and PR for Press2Reset Melissa Kay and Aenne Schumann and BioWare Event Consultant and Rated NA Podcast host Hilary Shapiro to draw back the covers on the sensual side of games and game culture.</paneldescription>

<paneltitle>The Worst of the Worst: Hacking, Exploitation, and Abuse within Online Games</paneltitle>
<paneltime>10:00pm - 11:00pm</paneltime>
<paneldescription>Online games provide us with endless entertainment and are an amazing way to meet and connect with people across the world. However, like all media, there is a dark underworld beneath online games: the hacking of game clients or servers, malware attacks, the exploitation of game mechanics, and the abuse of fellow players. For an hour, Alex will tell the stories that don't get told about online games, from abuse by employees to game mechanic scripting, personal threats to payment disputes. We will also delve into what both players and developers can do to discourage the abuse of their favorite online games. </paneldescription>

<paneltitle>Bad Games</paneltitle>
<paneltime>12:00pm - 1:00pm</paneltime>
<paneldescription>We've all played "bad" games, but what truly makes a game "bad?" Is gaming beauty not in the eye of the beholder? Is one's miserable experience not simply subjective opinion? Is there such a thing as an objectively "bad" game? More importantly, however we define the term, do bad games serve a purpose? Much as how without evil, there can be no good, without the worst of gaming, how could we possibly recognize the best? It turns out that the problem is not in defining what makes a game "bad," but in what makes a game a "game." Some games are great at certain things, but terrible at others. Candyland teaches children colors and counting, but is a terrible candidate for a serious tournament. Dungeons ~ampersand~ Dragons is great for that heroic fantasy adventure, but not so much for your future cyberpunk transhumanist court drama. Silver Surfer serves as a lesson (and a warning) to future game designers the world over. Join us for a lively discussion of the worst of gaming, what that truly means, and what we can learn from "bad" games. You may find that some of the worst games ever made can be some of the most fun you've ever had.</paneldescription>

<paneltitle>Gender Diversity in Games: Where Are All The Believable Female Characters?</paneltitle>
<paneltime>2:00pm - 3:00pm</paneltime>
<paneldescription>As the videogame entertainment medium matures, why hasn't its depiction of women matured with it? Graphics, game mechanics, animation, sound, and countless other technical achievements have given game developers the tools to deliver innovative games and incredibly realistic, moving character performances. Despite this, many videogames portray their characters within established, and stereotypical, tropes. In particular, most female characters continue to be portrayed in notoriously unrealistic terms both in their appearance and personality, progressing at a slower pace than their male videogame counterparts. Our panel of esteemed developers, writers, and journalists will examine why this continues to be the case, and the challenges facing developers and the videogame market in developing and marketing realistic female characters.</paneldescription>

<paneldescription>Tabletop roleplaying can let us explore other peoples' histories, contexts, and traumas with a particular empathy that no other medium provides. In the last decade, many new games have invited players to play within spaces informed by these histories, including Monsterhearts, which explores queerness via high-school monsters; Kagematsu, which engages its players in cross gender roles; Steal Away Jordan, which casts the players as black slaves in early America; and others. What are these games, how can we play them, and how can we integrate these lessons into our on-going campaigns? This panel -- featuring game authors Joe McDaldno (Monsterhearts, The Quiet Year) and Ben Lehman (Polaris, Beloved) as well as game critic Amy Sutedja (20by20room.org) -- will address wide-ranging questions from "How can I get a group to play this game?" to "How can we approach difficult material respectfully?" to "Is Twilight really as bad as they say?" </paneldescription>

<paneltime>3:00pm - 4:00pm</paneltime>
<paneldescription>Code, artwork, writing, music... you have to know a lot of things to make an indie game. But what about marketing? That takes a completely different set of skills. Often an afterthought, marketing can be one of the most crucial things you can do for your game. It's not enough to have a great blurb on your iTunes listing. You need an easily accessible website. An engaging trailer. An active news feed. A snappy press release. Reliable press contacts. Merch. But you're indie and you don't have a marketing department to turn to? Never fear. There's a way to manage a lot of this yourself. Join marketing professionals Hilary Heskett Shapiro: Events Consultant and Global Marketing Director whose clients include BioWare, Electronic Arts (EA), Hewlett-Packard (HP), and Princess Cruises; Kelly Wallick: Overlord for PAX's own Indie MEGABOOTH; Dallas Taylor: Creative Director for Defacto Sound, leading the sound team for many major launch trailers including Skyrim, Dishonored, Fallout: New Vegas, and Wolfenstein; Shaun Barrows: Promo Editor for the National Geographic Channel and brands including SXSW, Lexus, BMW, Hanes, and Indie MEGABOOTH and Technical Director for GORGEOUS ROBOT; and Miellyn Fitzwater Barrows: Creative Director for GORGEOUS ROBOT whose clients include TLC, Travel, HGTV, Science Channel, and Tin Man Games. Moderated by Nerd Appropriate Community Manager Ash Sevilla, they'll give you pro-tips and tricks on the game to end all games: getting YOURS noticed.</paneldescription>

<paneltitle>The Brain Dump: Eight Developers Reveal the Dark Secrets of Game Development</paneltitle>
<paneltime>4:30pm - 5:30pm</paneltime>
<paneldescription>The truth of game development is often hidden from the gaming public behind walls of PR and the desire to put the best face on a complicated and often painful process. Well no more! Join us for a trip inside the sausage factory, where a number of uniquely opinionated developers tell you things you never expected to hear about how games get made. Each speaker gets five minutes to spill their own truth about game development, with a rousing and no doubt contentious Q~ampersand~A session at the end. Featuring a diverse range of speakers who have worked on everything from Diablo and X-Com to Rock Band and Mark of the Ninja, all the participants share harrowing tales you never thought you'd hear coming out of our mouths in this light-hearted, fast-paced, and brutally honest session. </paneldescription>
